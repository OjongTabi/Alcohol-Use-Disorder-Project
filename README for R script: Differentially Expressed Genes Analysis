This R script is used to process gene expression data, perform differential gene expression analysis (DEA), and generate a volcano plot for visualization. The specific purpose of this analysis is to identify genes that are differentially expressed in different brain regions of control and alcohol use disorder subjects.

The script follows these steps:

1. **Library loading**: Loads necessary R libraries for the data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

2. **Setting up working directory**: Defines the working directory where the data files are located.

3. **Data import and preprocessing**: Imports and preprocesses the Gene Transfer Format (GTF) and gene expression count matrix files. Also, metadata related to the samples are imported and preprocessed.

4. **Metadata preprocessing**: Further preprocessing of metadata is done to clean and prepare the data for the downstream analysis. 

5. **Variance partitioning**: Performs variance partitioning following the package documentation.

6. **Data preparation for DEA**: Extracts sample IDs from column names, filters the count matrix based on sample IDs present in the metadata, and prepares a DGEList object (an S4 object class defined in edgeR for storing read counts for a set of RNA samples) for the edgeR package.

7. **Differential Expression Analysis**: Performs a DEA using the limma-voom method. This includes filtering out lowly expressed genes, normalizing the library sizes, applying the voom transformation, and fitting a linear model with specified contrasts.

8. **Volcano plot visualization**: Creates a volcano plot of the differentially expressed genes.

## Dependencies

This script relies on several R packages, including:

- `tidyverse`: for data manipulation and visualization.
- `variancePartition`: for variance partitioning in gene expression data.
- `limma` and `edgeR`: for differential expression analysis.
- `rtracklayer`: for reading and manipulating genomic annotations.
- `EnhancedVolcano`: for creating volcano plots.
- `magrittr`: for chaining operations with the pipe operator (`%>%`).

Make sure these packages are installed before running the script. You can install them in R with the command `install.packages()`.

## Data Requirements

This script assumes the data is structured in a specific way. You need to have a GTF file with gene and transcript annotations, a count matrix file with gene expression data, and a metadata file containing information about the samples.

## Outputs

The script outputs a volcano plot showing the differentially expressed genes. The x-axis represents the log2 fold change, while the y-axis represents the -log10 adjusted p-value. The genes above the red line are the ones with an adjusted p-value less than 0.05, and the genes outside the blue lines are the ones with an absolute log2 fold change greater than 1. These are typically considered significantly differentially expressed.

**Note**: This script does not automatically save the output files or plots. Uncomment the `write.csv()` and `ggsave()` lines to save the output and plots, respectively.
